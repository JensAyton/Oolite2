OOSoundMixer.h

Abstract mixer for sound engines that use the mixer-and-channel model.

In this model, each sound source is played through a channel, and channels are
mixed together by the mixer. The number of channels is fixed, but high enough
that the limit doesnâ€™t practically matter.

The Core Audio and SDL engines use this approach.

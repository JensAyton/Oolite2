	OOGarbageCollectionSupport.h
	
	Oolite does not use garbage collection, because:
	* It wasn’t available in Mac OS X when Oolite was first written.
	* Garbage collection semantics are different between Mac OS X and GNUstep.
	* Converting a large code base to use garbage collection is a pretty big
	  job anyway, and managing code with two different garbage collectors (the
	  Objective-C one and the JavaScript one) sounds like... fun.
	
	However, some Mac-specific tools which share code with Oolite do use
	garbage collection, and the shared code needs to be written to support
	this.
	
	Other than the attributes and functions in this file, the main artefact of
	garbage collection is the -finalize method in some classes. This is the GC
	equivalent of -dealloc, but does less work since most of the work in
	-dealloc is freeing object ivars that are themselves garbage collected.
